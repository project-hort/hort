//! Format-agnostic index-construction trait skeleton (see
//! `docs/architecture/explanation/index-construction.md`).
//!
//! This module defines the **Source → Filter → Builder** pipeline's
//! traits and the spine [`VersionEntry`] all three operate on. Each
//! per-format crate (npm, pypi, cargo) supplies its own
//! [`IndexBuilder`] implementation; `hort-app` supplies the shared
//! [`IndexFilter`] implementations (see
//! [`crate::use_cases::index_filters`]); the per-format HTTP crate
//! supplies the `IndexSource` that produces `Vec<VersionEntry>` from
//! either the local DB (hosted) or an upstream fetch (proxy).
//!
//! [`PerVersionPayload`] is a single closed-sum
//! type whose set of variants grows exactly once per per-format
//! migration.
//!
//! # Dep direction
//!
//! `hort-formats` depends on `hort-app` (see
//! `crates/hort-formats/Cargo.toml`), not the other way around — the
//! `IndexFilter` impls could not reference traits defined in a crate
//! `hort-app` does not depend on. So the traits + spine types are
//! **defined here in `hort-app`**, and `hort-formats::index_serve`
//! re-exports them. This:
//!
//! - keeps the filter implementations on the same side of the
//!   dep-graph as the trait they implement (no circular dep);
//! - mirrors the existing [`VersionOrdering`] re-export shape from
//!   [`crate::use_cases::index_serve_filter`] (defined in `hort-app`,
//!   re-exported from `hort-formats::index_serve`);
//! - gives format-crate consumers a single import path
//!   (`use hort_formats::index_serve::{…}`);
//! - matches the existing precedent —
//!   [`crate::use_cases::index_serve_filter::filter_served_versions`]
//!   already lives in `hort-app` despite being consumed by format
//!   crates through the same re-export pattern.
